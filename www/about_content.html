  <h3>What is Open Council?</h3>

  <div class="row-fluid">
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Keep track of City Council and Committee meetings as they are published</strong>. The City's e-Agenda tool is great, but it requires that you check in to find out what's going on. Open Council monitors the agendas and minutes automatically and will tweet when new documents are found. So follow @LdnWatch and you'll never miss an update. <a href="meetings/all">You can browse all meetings</a> too - and there is a handy dashboard for viewing meeting documents and agenda items.</p>
  </span>
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Have a public discussion about Council and Committee meetings</strong>. Using the Comments tab in any meeting you can discuss the proceedings or agenda publicly. Please note that city officials are not monitoring the discussion. If you want to reach out to members of council, go <a href='#' onclick='alert("coming soon");'>here</a>.

  <h3>What's the tech behind Open Council?</h3>
  <p>
    <strong>OpenCouncil is an implementation (possibly also a mutilation) of Kevin O'Donnell's OttWatch system:</strong>
    <blockquote>
  OttWatch runs on an Amazon EC2 "small" Unbuntu server, using Apache, PHP and Mysql. The GUI prettiness is courtesy of Bootstrap, and the REST style application design is 
  aided by Epiphany. <a href="https://github.com/kevinodotnet/ottwatch">Source code is tracked in GIT</a> and deployments are handled by Capistrano. All in all, a wonderful system to work in that couldn't be more different
  than my day job.<br /><br /><i>- Kevin O'Donnell</i></blockquote>
