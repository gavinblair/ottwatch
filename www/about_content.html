  <h3>What can I do with OttWatch?</h3>

  <div class="row-fluid">
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Keep track of City Council and Committee meetings as they are published</strong>. The City's e-Agenda tool is great, but it requires that you check in to find out what's going on. Ottawa
  Watch monitors the agendas <strike>and minutes</strike> automatically and will tweet when new documents are found. So follow @OttWatch and you'll never miss an update. <a href="meetings/all">You can browse all meetings</a> too - and there is a handy dashboard for viewing meeting documents and agenda items (ex: <a href="meetings/City%20Council/2478">City Council Feb 27, 2012</a>).</p>
  </span>
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Find out who's lobbying the City</strong>. Lobbyists are required to file reports within 15 days of any lobbying activities. But again, do you really want to check the Lobbyist Registry
  every day? I don't. The @OttWatch twitter account will let you know when lobbyists have entered their data. You can also search for lobbyist data from the home page.
  <i>(FYI: The lobbyist search is a bit flaky at the moment after I discovered multiple lobbyists with the same name. I'll fix this eventually).</i>
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Keep track of Development Applications.</strong>. 
  Again, the city makes this information available on a not-bad search tool. OttWatch tweets new and updated development applications as they are detected, and 
  offers a toasty-quick page of all applications for easy reference (instead of 26 pages of search results).</p>
  </span>
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Who's building and demolishing?</strong>. The city puts out a ton-load of opendata (yay Ottawa!), including a <a href="http://app06.ottawa.ca/en/city_hall/statisticsdata/opendata/info/constr_demo_pool_permits/index.htm">monthly dump of construction, demolition, and pool-enclosure permits</a>. I'm in the process of pulling this data into the system. I won't tweet it
  (tens of permits a day) but it will be handy for geographic lookups down the line.
  </p>

  <div class="row-fluid">
  <span class="span6">
  <p><strong>Use the API in your own applications</strong>. 
	See the <a href="api/about">API About</a> page for full details about the API OttWatch provides to other developers. Morphing some of the 
	City's opendata into a Mysql database is not hard, but is not trivial either. If you want to skip right away to mobile app development,
	use the JSON!

  <h3>Do you have other features in mind?</h3>
  <p>I most certainly do!</p>
  </span>
  <span class="span6">
  <h3>Could you make OttWatch do X, Y or Z?</h3>
  <p>
  Maybe!

  <h3>What's the tech behind OttWatch?</h3>
  <p>
  OttWatch runs on an Amazon EC2 "small" Unbuntu server, using Apache, PHP and Mysql. The GUI prettiness is courtesy of Bootstrap, and the REST style application design is 
  aided by Epiphany. Source code is tracked in GIT and deployments are handled by Capistrano. All in all, a wonderful system to work in that couldn't be more different
  than my day job.

  <span class="span6">
  <h3>Why are you doing this?</h3>
  <p>If you follow my main <a href="http://kevino.ca">kevino.ca</a> site you'll know I'm into politics, and have goals there. 
  But the values that spur me to work on this project are rooted in open-government, transparency, and accountability. 
  The City of Ottawa is making good progress on opening up data and making it easier for citizens to engage. 
  OttWatch couldn't happen without the City opening up as much as it already has. 
  I have some technical skills, so my goal is to help open up the data even more, and make it available to a wider audience. 
  You'll see what I mean when some more features come out.  There's a method to the madness!</p>
